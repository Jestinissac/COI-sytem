Based on the COI Workflow.docx (and its accompanying Global COI Form and COI Template), the "original scope" takes a conditional view of the Parent Company. It is not required for every client—only for specific risk categories.

Here is the breakdown of the original scope's view:

1. It is a "Conditional" Mandatory Field
The original scope does not require a "Parent Company" for every standard local engagement. It only mandates this data if the client triggers specific "Global" criteria.

Standard Local Client: The scope (via the COI Template) only requires "Client Name". It does not explicitly ask for the Parent Company or Ownership Structure.


International / PIE Client: If the client is flagged as "International" or a "Public Interest Entity (PIE)" in the Global COI Form, the "Ultimate Parent Company" field becomes Mandatory.

2. It is Used for "Global" Independence Checks Only
In the original scope documents, the Parent Company is primarily used to satisfy the BDO Network (Global) requirements, not necessarily the local operational workflow.

The View: The Parent Company is viewed as a Compliance Attribute for independence clearance (checking if BDO globally audits the parent), rather than an operational attribute for the local project.

The Gap: The original scope does not explicitly describe an automated check against the Parent Company for local conflicts (e.g., checking if BDO Kuwait is doing Advisory for the Parent while doing Audit for the Subsidiary). It relies on the "Global Conflict of Interest Review" manual process to catch these.

Summary of the "Original Scope" View
Data Entry: Manual entry of "Ultimate Parent Company".

Trigger: Only required if Client Type = Potential OR Client is PIE = Yes OR International = Yes.

Validation: No automated validation described (manual text field).

Integration: No mention of validating this against a master database (like PRMS).

Implication for Your Meeting: You should verify if this "Conditional" view is sufficient.

Question: "The original scope only captures 'Parent Company' for International/PIE clients. Do we need to capture Parent Company for LOCAL groups as well to prevent local conflicts (e.g., conflicting services between two local group entities)?
