# COI Prototype – Documentation

Prototype-specific documentation, separate from **production handover** (see repo root `docs/production-handover/`).

## Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **prototype/** | Build verification, test reports, implementation logs, fix summaries, and feature notes for the prototype only. |
| **handover-updates/** | Reserved for prototype-side handover update notes that link to production handover. |

## Production handover

For handoff and production-readiness, use the repo-level docs:

- **docs/production-handover/** – Handoff guides and production-ready docs.
- **docs/coi-system/** – COI governance, scope, and rules.

Only prototype build/test/implementation notes live here; production-facing docs stay in `docs/`.
