# Envision PRMS – Documentation

Documentation is organized by **category** and clearly separates **production handover** from **prototype** materials.

## Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **production-handover/** | Handoff guides and production-ready docs for the build team. Primary reference for moving from prototype to production. |
| **coi-system/** | COI System governance, CMA/IESBA rules, research, scope, and architecture (formerly "COI System" folder). |
| **analysis/** | Gap analyses, verification reports, implementation summaries, and research findings. |
| **reference/** | Comparisons, checklists, UX principles, and feature lists. |

## Prototype vs production

- **Production handover**: Use `production-handover/` for handoff and production-readiness. Start with **Prototype_vs_Production_Handoff_Guide.md**.
- **Prototype-only docs**: Build verification, test reports, and implementation logs for the prototype live under **coi-prototype/docs/prototype/**.
