Dear Nisma,

Thank you for the clarification.

We will align as follows:

**1. Local COIs (current phase)**  
- The service selector (Line of Service + Service Type) will follow the **provided BDO template** only.  
- We will **not** implement the CMA matrix or leading questions for local COIs in this phase.  
- The form will show the template list as shared (Audit & Assurance, Advisory, Tax, Accounting, IT, Other Services, with the corresponding service types under each).

**2. Global COIs**  
- **Detailed services** (e.g. extended service list / structure) will be required **only when the user selects Global COI / international operations**.  
- We will ensure the detailed service selector is shown only in that flow.

**3. Amended Invision system and segregation for Tax team**  
- We are working on the requested segregation and the amended Invision system so that access can be shared with the Tax team.  
- We will revert separately with a **concrete expected timeframe** (by [date]) once we have confirmed the scope and dependencies with our technical team.

Please let us know if the above alignment for local vs global COIs matches your expectations. We will proceed on that basis and keep you updated on the Invision segregation timeline.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,  
Jestin Abraham

**Notes for Jestin**

- **Timeframe:** Replace “by [date]” with the date by which you will send the detailed timeline (e.g. “by [Friday, 7 Feb 2026]”) or remove that phrase and only say “we will revert with a concrete expected timeframe.”
- **Template reference:** If you have a specific document name (e.g. “BDO COI Form Template – Kuwait”) you can add: “as per the [template name] shared.”
- **Invision:** If the segregation work is owned by another team or system, you may want to add: “in coordination with [relevant team/system owner]” when you mention the amended Invision system.
