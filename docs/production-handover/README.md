# Production Handover

Documents here support **handover from prototype to production**. They are the primary reference for the technical team building the production COI system.

## Contents

- **Prototype_vs_Production_Handoff_Guide.md** – Main handoff: prototype vs production, placeholders, integration points.
- **HANDOFF_GUIDE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** – Summary of handoff guide updates.
- **PRMS_INTEGRATION_CURRENT_STATE.md** – Current PRMS integration state for production planning.
- **PERMISSION_SYSTEM_*** – Permission system verification and handover notes.
- **MASTER_SEARCH_HANDOFF_UPDATE.md** – Master search handover updates.

Use these when planning or implementing the production build; keep prototype-only notes in `coi-prototype/docs/prototype/`.
