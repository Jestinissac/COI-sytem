Based on the sources, the following user journeys represent the sequential and interdependent activities required to move an engagement from its initial vetting through to project execution.

### 1\. The Requester Journey: Initiating Vetting

The journey begins with a Director or an authorised team member who has finalized a service scope and pricing manually outside the system 1-3.

* **Step 1: System Entry:** The Requester logs into the Conflict of Interest (COI) system to initiate a new request 4, 5\.  
* **Step 2: Client Selection:** Instead of typing a name, the user selects the client from a predefined dropdown list to maintain data integrity; if the client is new, they must first request its creation in the master database 6-8.  
* **Step 3: Data Submission:** The user enters the exact description of the service and mandatory compliance data, including the full legal name, commercial registration, and complete ownership structure 9-11.  
* **Step 4: Conflict Resolution:** If the system detects a similar name or an active engagement via automated checks, the user is blocked from submitting until they provide a formal written justification for the potential conflict 12-14.

### 2\. The Compliance Officer Journey: Regulatory Vetting

Once a request is submitted, it enters the Compliance Workspace for a formal review 15, 16\.

* **Step 1: Detailed Review:** The Compliance Officer evaluates the provided ownership structure, PIE (Public Interest Entity) status, and related entities 10-12.  
* **Step 2: Independence Verification:** If the client has international operations, the officer verifies that mandatory Global independence clearance has been obtained 9, 14, 17\.  
* **Step 3: Decision Making:** The officer selects a status: Approved, Approved with Restrictions, Need More Information, or Reject 18, 19\.  
* **Step 4: Rerouting:** If more information is required, the request is sent back to the Requester; otherwise, approved requests move forward in the hierarchy 20, 21\.

### 3\. The Partner Journey: Final Authorisation

The Assigned Partner uses a "One-Click Dashboard" to oversee the pipeline and grant final business approval 15, 22, 23\.

* **Step 1: Strategic Oversight:** The Partner reviews the complete request, including the compliance decision and any comments regarding business context 20, 21\.  
* **Step 2: Authorisation:** The Partner performs the final sign-off; if the Partner requires further clarity, the request is returned to the Compliance Department rather than the original Requester 20, 24\.

### 4\. The Finance Officer Journey: Financial Coding

Following Partner approval, the request is routed to the Finance Team to formalise the engagement's financial tracking 20, 24\.

* **Step 1: Risk Assessment:** The Finance Officer reviews the client's payment history and assesses credit risk 21, 25\.  
* **Step 2: Parameter Entry:** The officer enters essential financial details such as credit terms and the chosen currency 24, 25\.  
* **Step 3: Code Generation:** The system automatically generates a unique, permanent Engagement Code (e.g., ENG-2025-TAX-00142) which is essential for all future project operations 20, 26, 27\.

### 5\. The Admin Team Journey: Execution and Monitoring

The Admin Team manages the transition from a cleared request to an active engagement 16, 20\.

* **Step 1: Document Preparation:** Upon receiving COI clearance, the Admin team prepares the formal proposal or engagement letter, incorporating the new Finance Code 25, 28\.  
* **Step 2: Response Tracking:** The team records the execution date, which triggers a 30-day monitoring window 24, 25, 28\.  
* **Step 3: Alert Management:** The system automatically sends reminders to the Requester and Admin every 10 days; if no response is received by day 31, the Admin observes the system automatically lapsing and closing the request 19, 29, 30\.  
* **Step 4: Activation:** Once the client signs the documents, the Admin uploads the file and updates the status to "Active", which triggers a three-year renewal alert for future auditing 29, 31, 32\.

### 6\. The Project Manager Journey: Operational Setup

With a valid Finance Code, the journey moves to the Project Resource Management System (PRMS) for execution 1, 27, 33\.

* **Step 1: Project Initialization:** The Project Manager begins the project creation process in PRMS by entering the authorised Finance Code 15, 34, 35\.  
* **Step 2: Validation:** PRMS checks the code against the COI database; if the code is missing or invalid, the user is blocked from creating the project 15, 33, 35\.  
* **Step 3: Resource Mapping:** The manager maps independently created tasks and teams to the newly validated project 36-38.  
* **Step 4: Operational Control:** The manager monitors timesheet entries, noting that the system automatically blocks any entries made after the project’s targeted end date unless a formal revision is approved 27, 38, 39\.

**Analogy for the Integrated Process:**Think of the **COI System** as an **Embassy** issuing a visa. You must provide extensive documentation (ownership, registration) and pass a background check (conflict vetting) before you are granted a unique visa number (Finance Code). The **PRMS** is the **Border Control** at your destination; you may have a suitcase full of resources (tasks and teams), but you cannot pass the gate or start your journey (the project) until your visa number is verified as valid and current.
