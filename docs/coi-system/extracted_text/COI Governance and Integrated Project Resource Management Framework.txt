The integrated solution establishes a mandatory governance framework where the Conflict of Interest (COI) system acts as the upstream gateway that must authorize all activity before the Project Resource Management System (PRMS) can initiate operational tasks 1-5. Based on the latest understanding, the system does not handle the manual creation of quotes or commercial pricing; instead, it captures the finalized scope to trigger the compliance workflow 4, 6-9.
1. System Architecture and Objective
The core objective is to ensure that no proposal or engagement letter is issued or signed without a full, documented, and approved COI review 1, 10-13.
COI System: A separate governance application dedicated to pre-engagement vetting, automated conflict detection, and sequential authorization 3, 12-14.
PRMS: Functions as the Client Master Data source and handles post-engagement management, including resource allocation, timesheet tracking, and billing 2, 3, 7, 15-17.
2. End-to-End Business Process Flow
Phase 1: Request Initiation and Data Vetting (Pre-Proposal)
The process begins after a quote is prepared manually (e.g., via external documents) and before a formal proposal is issued to a client 4, 7, 9.
Initiation: A Director or authorized team member initiates a COI request for either a new proposal or an engagement 13, 18-20.
Client Selection: The client is selected from a dropdown list pulled directly from the PRMS records; if the client is new, a request must be made to the PRMS admin to add them first to ensure no duplication of client data 16, 19-21.
Mandatory Data Input: The requester enters the exact description and scope of the intended service 9, 13, 22-25.
Ownership Structure: Critical data fields are enforced, including parent company name, full ownership structure, Public Interest Entity (PIE) status, and a list of all related/affiliated entities under common control 12-14, 26-31.
Note: The "Ultimate Parent Company" field is a mandatory requirement for International, PIE, or Potential clients 32, 33.
Automated Validation: The system performs Automated Duplication Checks using fuzzy matching to detect existing active proposals or engagements for the entity, its parent, or its subsidiaries 12-14, 25, 31, 34-38.
Blocking Mechanism: If a duplication is detected, the system blocks the submission unless the user provides a formal justification for compliance review 12-14, 25, 31, 34, 36, 38.
Global Clearance: If "International Operations" are selected, an additional tab is activated and Global independence clearance is mandatory 13, 14, 26, 28, 30, 39-41.
Phase 2: Sequential Review and Authorization
Once submitted, the request moves through a strictly defined approval hierarchy 12, 25, 42, 43.
Compliance Review: The Compliance Department reviews the request and chooses from: Approved, Approved with restrictions, Need more information, or Reject 13, 25, 35, 37, 42-46.
Partner Approval: Following compliance clearance, the request is transferred to the Assigned Partner for final approval 13, 25, 42-47.
Financial Coding: Approved requests are routed to the Finance Team to enter financial parameters (e.g., credit terms, currency) and assess risk 25, 42, 45, 46, 48.
Code Generation: The system automatically generates a unique and permanent Engagement/Finance Code (e.g., ENG-2025-TAX-00142), which is required for project initiation in PRMS 10, 11, 13, 25, 42-44, 48, 49.
Phase 3: Proposal Execution and Monitoring
Execution: Upon receiving COI clearance, the Admin Team prepares and sends the proposal document (including the new Finance Code) to the client 13, 25, 42, 43, 48, 50, 51.
30-Day Monitoring Window: The system records the execution date to activate a 30-day monitoring window 13, 41, 48, 50-52.
Automated Alerts: Reminders are sent to the requester, Admin, and Partner every 10 days from the date of approval 35, 37, 41.
Lapse Policy: If no client confirmation is received within 30 days, the request automatically lapses and is closed; any later response requires a new COI request 13, 35, 37, 41, 43, 52-56.
Phase 4: Engagement and Operational Handoff
Engagement Phase: When the client approves the proposal, the status is updated to Active, and the Admin prepares the formal Engagement Letter 53, 57, 58.
Mandatory Forms: During this phase, ISQM forms (e.g., Client Screening Questionnaire, New Client Acceptance checklist) must be filled and attached 13, 39, 40, 42.
Renewal Alerts: Execution of the engagement letter activates an automatic alert for renewal after 3 years, with prior notices sent 90 days in advance 11, 13, 49, 52, 53, 57-59.
PRMS Project Creation: The finalized Engagement Code formally precedes and authorizes project definition within PRMS 1, 2, 5, 25, 42, 53, 60.
Validation: PRMS validates the code against the COI authorization table; project creation is blocked if an invalid code is entered 61-63.
Phase 5: Post-Engagement Management (PRMS)
Project Identification: Project IDs are auto-generated using BDO logic and reference the Service Year 25, 42, 61, 63-67.
Independent Resource Mapping: Tasks and Teams are created independently and subsequently mapped to their respective projects in a dedicated area 25, 42, 66, 68.
Operational Controls: Timesheet entries are mapped to specific tasks, and the system blocks entry after the project's targeted end date unless a revision is approved 25, 42, 66, 69-72.
Financial Oversight: The system tracks out-of-pocket expenses (OPE), maintains a billing schedule supporting split billing, and manages a payment tracking workflow ($Print Invoice \rightarrow Mark Issued \rightarrow Mark Received$) 66, 71, 73-77.
